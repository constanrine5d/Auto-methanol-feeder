# Syringe Pump with Arduino nano

An automatic injection system that uses an arduino nano to control a syringe pump. 

It was originally made to feed Pichia Pastoris yeast cultures with a specified volume of methanol each day (2.5 mL of MeOH for 3 days that I would be absent from the lab).

Thanks to randomstructures for the original mechanism which was slightly modified for my needs. Original mechanism: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2797132
